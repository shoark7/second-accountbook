# My Second accountbook program in Python
---
## :question: What is this repo about
Long time no see. This is a new program that I've been working on.  
My first project with Python was an [Account book program](https://github.com/shoark7/Persoanl_accountbook).  
It could get expenditure data and dump it by pickle like it is a database.  

Now I want to see how my Python has gotten improved.  
Please check the code and leave a comment if you can.  
Any review would be thankful :blush:  

## :question: What's this repo's characteristic
This program's most brilliant characteristic is that **it uses package structure.**  
I'm the next generation's package maker. I'm sure.  
So I've studied about package structure and been making with it.

# To be continued when it's fully developed. It's about 70% developted.It's 2017/01/04 now.
Thank you :)
